Next-generation developer-first NoSQL database.

AnnaDB is an in-memory data store with disk persistence. It can work as the main data storage and the cache layer as well. Rust lang under the hood makes it memory-safe and fast.

## Features

- Flexible object structure - simple primitives and complicated nested containers could be stored in AnnaDB
- Relations - you can link any object to another, and AnnaDB will resolve this relation on finds, updates, and other operations.
- Transactions - out of the box
