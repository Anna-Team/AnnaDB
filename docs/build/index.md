Next-generation developer-first NoSQL database.

AnnaDB moves familiar programming languages' patterns into the databases world to solve the problem of the relations: 

*Every object and sub-object (item of a vector or map) that was stored in AnnaDB has a link id. This link can be placed as a field value of any other object and the database will fetch and process it automatically on all the operations without additional commands in queries.*

Features:

- Flexible object structure
- Relations
- Transactions
